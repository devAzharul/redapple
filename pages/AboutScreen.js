The difference is that they give you a menu of services to choose from. We don't, because every client represents a new brand, a new set of circumstances and a new opportunityâ€”no two strategies are ever the same.
                                Instead, our services are only recommended once we've established a strategy for mutating your brand from traditional media to the digital realm. Whether that strategy includes a website overhaul supplemented by traditional advertising or a social media blitz coupled with web video is yet to be seen.</p>

But we know it's more than that. It's change. It's the fight between trying to ignore it and trying to fit it into your life. It's everywhere and it's what we do.

                                While traditional advertising is important (those TV spots and radio commercials), we don't stop there. Studio CMP takes a look at where your customers are and designs marketing plans targeted towards those spaces. There's no sense in you being where you're customers aren't. Your opportunities exist in both what is well known and what is unknown. They exist in the smallest of details and the largest of concepts. And they're all interconnected. Just because you've never done that, doesn't mean you shouldn't.</p>
